# Fantasy Adventure

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

## Brief

The task is to model a fantasy adventure. The game will have players, who will have a number of health points and weapons/spells. Players will fall into different categories:

**Dwarves, Barbarians, Knights**

- Each of these will have a weapon and fight with other players
- Should be able to change their weapon at any point in the game

**Warlocks and Wizards**

- They will be able to cast spells on others
- They will have a mythical creature who will defend them from attackers
- Should be able to change spells or creature at any point in the game

**Clerics**

- They will have healing tools with which they can heal other players
- Should be able to change healing tool at any point in the game

**Rooms**

- The game will also have rooms to work through
- Each room should either have some kind of treasure to collect or an Enemy to defeat before moving on

### MVP

- Create the players and rooms for the adventure
- Give different players properties/methods that are specific to their own class
- The user should complete rooms by either collecting treasure or defeating an enemy and a new room will be presented to them

### Extensions

- Create a Quest for the players to work through
- Possibly a collection of rooms to go through and the quest completes when all rooms are completed
